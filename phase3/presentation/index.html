                    Core of presentation: at this point in the presentation you must talk about:

                    Vulnerabilities (possible exploits of the vulnerabilities) and how you fixed them.
                    Feel free to go into technical details, but keep it short, clear and entertaining.
                    Report possible changes in OWASP and CVSS values (e.g. from high to medium,
                    etc.) including reasoning for these changes in the values.

                    Fix slides: For each vulnerability discovered in Phase 2 by your team or the team that tested your
                    application, you should summarize the fix that you implemented:
                     Path(s) of file(s) which was modified for the fix
                     Line number(s) which were modified in each file
                     NOTE: You can use a diff utility but you should only report the changes relevant for one particular
                    fix per vulnerability (not just a diff of all changes to phase 1).
                     Textual description of your countermeasures and the reason why they fix the problem.

                </section>


                <section>

                    Use-case slides: will serve as a user manual describing all the use-cases that work using the same
                    format as in the Phase 1 Deliverables document for each use-case.
                     Mention the format of the batch file and any other data formats needed to use the application!
                     Each use case must have a video (screencast) associate with it that demonstrates the main-flow
                    of the use-case. A user must be able to use the app by simply looking at the video.
                     The video must have the same name as the use-case and a resolution of 1280x1024.
                     The format of the video must be MP4, the video codec must be H.264 and the audio codec must
                    be AAC. The file must be located in the Videos-TeamX-Phase3 folder.
                     The quality of the video must be good enough to be able to read the text shown on the
                    screen.
                     In case passwords are typed in please add video annotations for the viewer to know the
                    password.
