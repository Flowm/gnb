NOTE: In the report you MUST ONLY talk about your app

1.First Page: Course title, Phase title, team number and team members (full names)

2.Second Page: executive summary

3.Third Page: table of contents

4.Fourth Page: time tracking table (info / student / task at hour granularity)
Tasks should be evenly distributed â€“ project management part (this will be graded)

5.Application Architecture: next few pages should describe the architecture of your solution including UML diagrams, interaction with other systems and dependencies on external libraries

6.Security Measures: enumerate the security features your application uses and which attacks each feature defends against (specify which features you implemented and which you borrowed/use from other libraries)

7.Fixes: For each vulnerability discovered in Phase 4 by your team or the team that tested your application, you should summarize the fix (security measure) that you implemented:
- Path(s) of file(s) which were modified for the fix
- Line number(s) which were modified in each file
- NOTE: You can use a diff utility but you should only report the changes relevant for one particular fix per vulnerability (not just a diff of all changes to phase 3).
- Textual description of your countermeasures and why it fixes the problem (i.e. the effect that the modifications have against attack).
