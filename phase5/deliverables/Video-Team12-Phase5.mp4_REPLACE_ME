2. Make this video like you would want to sell your solution to a real bank.
3. Donâ€™t just screencast client registration, be more creative and try to impress!

NOTE: This video will be shown during the guest lecture from our sponsor (February 2nd 2016) in case you win one of the top 3 prizes. If so be prepared to give your presentation again + the video
