\chapter{Application Architecture}\label{chapter:application_architecture}
The \gnb{} application was built using a PHP backend and a web-based (HTML + Javascript) frontend. Also, the solution may provide the clients of \gnb{} with an additional SCS (short for SmartCardSimulator) software, which is needed to provide 2-step authentication during transactions and can be used on any system that supports Java 1.7+.\newline
The application was almost entirely developed without the aid of external libraries, preferring the use of builtin APIs and a custom architecture. Here is a list of the used libraries, which will be later on described more in details, along with their interaction with the system:
\begin{itemize}
	\item PHPMailer (see \texttt{https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer})
	\item fpdf (see \texttt{http://www.fpdf.org/})
	\item pdf encryption script (see \texttt{http://www.fpdf.org/en/script/script37.php})
	\item secureimage (see \texttt{https://github.com/dapphp/securimage})
\end{itemize}

In the following section we will discuss the architecture of the whole web application; we will also provide dedicated sections for a more detailed analysis of the Entity-Relationship model used in the database as well as the architecture of the Smart Card Simulator.

\section{Architecture}\label{section:architecture}
The architecture is based on an Apache web server, running the \gnb{} website, and a MySQL database, both hosted on the same machine and directly communicating with each other. The web server contains the whole business logic of the application and communicates with the client's Browser via HTTP, where the GUI is shown. No frameworks are used on the backend or on the frontend, since the web application was developed from scratch.\newline
\begin{figure}[h!tbp]

	\caption{Architecture of the solution}
	\label{figure:architecture}
\end{figure}
We will now analyze the design of the solution in more detail, paying attention both to the backend and the frontend.\newline
The design is based on a simple model and multiple views, each of which is made up of a controller for that specific view and the view itself, which is generated dynamically in some cases.
The idea behind the whole design is to split different parts of each resulting webpage into logical subviews, making them independent from each other and allowing us to reuse them for different purposes.\newline
All resources are divided into packages, according to their scope and category.

\subsection{Resource Mapper}\label{subsection:resmapper}
In order to provide a more fine-grained granularity, a \texttt{resource\_mappings.php} component was implemented, allowing to query all resources via a single API. This file contains the mappings to all resources which views or pages may need to include: pages, classes, media and so on. By simply querying a logical name, a resource is returned, regardless of the package it is contained in. This way, different pages can be included at runtime, without having to resort to static paths. Also, no direct paths are ever used by other PHP classes, but always queried on \texttt{resource\_mappings} using logical names, thus avoiding inclusion attacks.
\begin{figure}[h!tbp]

	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/resource_mappings}
	\caption{Example of resource inclusion inside \texttt{new\_transaction.php}}
	\label{figure:resmappings}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Model}
The model used for the \gnb{} solution is made up of three main classes (see \autoref{figure:model}):
\begin{itemize}
	\item the \textbf{user}, in which all data relevant to the user is stored, i.e. ID, email, name, pin, preferred banking method and so on. This class also allows to approve/reject/block a user directly, using the related methods;
	\item each user can be associated to N accounts, each of which is identified by a unique ID and contains the current balance of the user as well as a reference to all past transactions;
	\item a \textbf{transaction} contains all the details concerning a specific transaction, including the ID, the source and destination account and so on.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/model_uml}
	\caption{Model UML}
	\label{figure:model}
\end{figure}
All model objects reflect the data stored on the database: after a successful query, the array containing the data read from the database is passed to the constructor of the an object, which will populate the fields of that object with the values passed in the array.

\subsection{Views}\label{subsection:views}
The application tries to reuse as many view components as possible, by building pages dynamically as shown in \autoref{figure:gui_design}.
\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/gui_design}
	\caption{Example of a page including a section and a frame}
	\label{figure:gui_design}
\end{figure}
While the \texttt{index.php}, \texttt{login.php} and \texttt{registration.php} pages follow an ad-hoc design, once logged in, all users refer directly to either the \texttt{employee.php} or the \texttt{client.php} page, depending on their role: whatever the operation, the requested page will always be one of these two; any direct request to another page will either redirect the user to the homepage or to a 404 error page. Both employees and clients have a similar GUI, with different sections (and site functionalities) that can be directly chosen from the navigation bar on top.\newline
Depending on the parameters passed by the client inside a POST request, the server will handle the request in order to generate the appropriate content for the page, which is achieved by simply including the correct pages (i.e. resources). The main parameters include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a \textbf{section}, which is chosen by the user via the navigation bar. There are only a few possible sections, each one generating a different GUI. The server queries the resource mapper with a logical name for the requested section, then includes it inside the container view (being either the employee or the client page);
	\item a \textbf{frame}, which is chosen by the user via a menu found on the left isde of each section. The server queries the resource mapper with a logical name for the requested frame, then includes it inside the container view, in this case being the section;
	\item other case-specific parameters that are usually handled by the target section or frame.
\end{itemize}
Using this "hierarchical" inclusion mechanism, we can generate complex pages by keeping the structure of the respective container views intact.
All PHP pages that provide HTML output perform strict access controls to avoid malicious attackers from accessing arbitrary pages or circumventing the application work-flow. Hence, while a user/attacker could manually request a page including a specific section and frame, this will return the desired page only if allowed by the current control flow, otherwise an error page will be displayed.

\subsection{Application Control Flow}
The adopted solution does not provide a centralized controller, but rather distributes the control of the application, along with the business logic, among the involved components, namely the views. The basic control flow of the application can be seen in \autoref{figure:view_graph}: blue arrows represent the possible inclusion of a section inside the container page, while red arrows represent the possible inclusion of a frame inside the container section. This flow can be directly controller by user via graphical buttons in the GUI.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/view_graph}
	\caption{Control flow of the web application}
	\label{figure:view_graph}
\end{figure}
The main controllers for the employees and the clients can be found respectively inside the \texttt{employee.php} and \texttt{client.php} files. These controllers include some basic logic, such as: username and role checks, timeout check and most importantly the inclusion of currently requested section.\newline
Each section, when included in the parent page, performs further checks depending on the specific business logic of that section. The main sections that the \gnb{} application offers, in which the users spend most of their time, are the \texttt{employee\_area.php} and the \texttt{my\_accounts.php} sections. Each of these offers several operations to the user, each of which is connected to a specific frame, where that operation is then carried out.\newline
Each frame, when included in the parent section, handles the business logic for a specific user operation. This includes verifying possible user inputs, then performing the required database queries and building the respective model objects. All the data displayed to the user is directly computed inside the frame. Some frames can only be displayed after performing a specific sequence of operations, resulting in a clean and fluid navigation, while interacting with the web application.\newline

\subsection{Client-side behaviour}
The navigation on the browser is handled by custom Javascript functions, contained in the following files:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{account.js}
	\item \texttt{client.js}
	\item \texttt{employee.js}
	\item \texttt{index.js}
	\item \texttt{registration.js}
\end{itemize}
Each of these files is loaded by the respective HTML page. When clicking on buttons on the GUI, a javascript function is called, depending on the operation that is being performed by the user. The called function may check if the user input is correct (displaying messages in case errors occured) and eventually perform a POST request to the server exploiting the \texttt{performPostRequest} function contained inside the \texttt{postRequest.js} file (this script is loaded automatically on every page). Following the control flow of the application, each call to this function usually involves passing a section and a frame parameter, as described in \autoref{subsection:views}.\newline
For some specific user operations, like an employee searching for a client, we decided to perform AJAX requests to the server. This allows us to dynamically load some content into the current page, instead of making the user reload the whole page.


\section{Database Schema}\label{section:db}
\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/database_model}
	\caption{Database model}
	\label{figure:dbmodel}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

The database schema was created using the \emph{MySQL Workbench}. The database schema is shown in \autoref{figure:dbmodel} and describes the following 6 entities:
\begin{description}
	\item[Table "user"] \hfill \\
	Contains all the user attributes including user ID, full name, mail, status (\texttt{unapproved}, \texttt{approved}, \texttt{rejected}, \texttt{blocked}), role (\texttt{client}, \texttt{employee}), salt and hash for the authentication, the device used for TAN authentication (\texttt{none} for users without account, otherwise \texttt{TANs} or the \texttt{SCS}), the PIN as well as the password reset hash and creation timestamp for this hash. Additionally the user ID is stored which approved/blocked/rejected the user the last time.
	
	\item[Table "account"] \hfill \\
	Contains the account number, the user ID of the owner and the timestamp of the last TAN that was used if the user is using the SCS (see \autoref{section:scs}).
	
	\item[Table "transaction"] \hfill \\
	Contains information about the status (\texttt{unapproved}, \texttt{approved}, \texttt{rejected}), the user ID of the approving/rejecting user and approval/rejection time of the transactions as well as the source and destination account, creation timestamp, amount and description of the transaction as well as the used TAN (if the SCS was not used).
	
	\item[Table "tan"] \hfill \\
	Contains the TANs and which account they belong to as well as a field specifying if the given TAN has been used (value is a timestamp) or not used (value is \texttt{NULL}).
	
	\item[Table "failed\_attempt"] \hfill \\
	Contains all failed attempts (e.g. failed \texttt{login} or invalid \texttt{tan}) and their timestamp associated to the user ID that attempted the action.
	
	\item[View "account\_overview"] \hfill \\
	Is used to obtain the balance for a given account number. As shown in \autoref{figure:accountoverviewfigure} this approach is not trivial. First (lines 8-9) we set Barney's balance to a fixed amount because all the welcome credits to new users are coming from his account. Then we exclude some transactions from our calculation, namely rejected transactions, unapproved transactions and transactions that have the same source- and destination account number (see lines 12-14). After that we determine the sign of the transaction --- it is either positive if the given account is the destination account, or negative if our account is the source account (see lines 17-19).

\section{Smart Card Simulator}\label{section:scs}
The SCS is a stand-alone Java application that can be downloaded as a \texttt{.jar} file via the web application without having to be logged in as a user, i.e. the SCS is free for anyone, although only clients of the bank can make use of it. This is because the SCS allows users to generate TANs on the fly when performing transactions, instead of reading pre-generated TANs from a finite list. \newline
The \gnb{} Smart Card Simulator does not require any kind of direct interaction with the PHP backend when used, hence clients can even run it from a machine disconnected from the internet and/or different than the one they are performing the transaction from. Also, the executable file is not bound to a specific account and could, therefore, be used by multiple clients as well (or for multiple accounts).
\subsection{Usage}
When using the SCS, users are required to insert their personal PIN and all details regarding a specific transaction (either manually or contained in a batch file). The SCS will then generate a pseudo-random TAN based on the user's input and a timestamp; the web application will challenge the client to input the same data inside the transaction HTML form as well, validating it against the generated TAN. In case the TAN is proved to be invalid, the transaction fails; this is either due to a user not inserting the same values inside the SCS and the transaction page, or the user providing an invalid PIN inside the application.\newline

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/scs_gui}
	\caption{Graphical User Interface of the SmartCard Simulator}
	\label{figure:scs_gui}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Class Design}
The solution includes the minimal amount of features required for the functionality to work. By doing so, we kept a clean and simple design, based on an MVP pattern (the architecture can be seen in \autoref{figure:scs_uml}). We will now briefly describe the solution and the involved components.\newline
$\bullet$ The \textbf{MainView} class captures user actions callbacks and dispatches them to the Presenter class, which acts as the controller of the whole application. The view was created via a GUI Builder, using Java Swing graphical components.\newline
Event listeners are created inline inside the \texttt{initComponents} private method and associated to some objects, like the \texttt{generateButton}. When choosing to generate a TAN, the \texttt{performGenerateTan} method is automatically called within the MainView, which will retrieve the user's input and call the appropriate method inside the presenter component, depending whether the user wants to perform a batch transaction or a single transaction.\newline
Upon a successful operation, the generated TAN will be displayed by the MainView, otherwise an error will be shown to the user.\newline
$\bullet$ The \textbf{Presenter} is in charge of the business logic. When a TAN generation request is dispatched to the presenter, this component checks the validity of all user input (or the contents of the batch file) and prepares it for being processed by the CustomTanGenerator class. After CustomTanGenerator has processed the data and generated a TAN, the presenter will take care of returning it to the MainView.
Since the application does not involve a real model, the only data which can be retrieved is given by the user's input.\newline
$\bullet$ \textbf{CustomTanGenerator} is accessed statically by the presenter, as it contains only the algorithm used to generate a TAN given some input parameters. This class does not need to keep any state and will directly return the generated TAN.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Security considerations}
As for any public cryptographic algorithm, the only thing that should be kept private is the secret shared between the client and the server, in this case being the PIN code, therefore the SCS application was not obfuscated in any way. This is also due to the overall low difficulty in reverse-engineering compiled Java code.\newline
The chosen solution is considered to be secure, as the input parameters (namely the batch transaction file or the details of a specific transaction) are hashed with a SHA-256 algorithm, together with the PIN of the user and a timestamp. 
The purpose of the timestamp is to add a degree of randomness inside the resulting TAN and avoiding replay attacks (the backend stores the time of the last transaction performed by a user). Although the timestamp can easily be guessed by an attacker, all the other values are strictly related to a specific transaction, and a brute-force attack would require a huge amount of attempts to either find a hash collision or the correct values. The \gnb{} application also provides a lockout mechanism in case a malicious attacker attempted to brute-force a TAN on the transaction page, locking him out indefinitely.\newline
Since the SCS application does not connect to the Internet in any way and the user is required to manually copy/paste a generated TAN inside the transaction page, an attacker would have to obtain complete access on the victim's machine, in order to obtain a valid TAN code and eventually brute-force the PIN. Since this is highly unlikely and in any case not due to the design of the application, the SmartCard Simulator can be considered secure.
