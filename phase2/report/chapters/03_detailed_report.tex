\vulntitle{OTG-CONFIG-003}{Test File Extensions Handling for Sensitive Information}
\vultable{\doge}{%
	The batch transaction functionality at \url{http:/IPADDRESS/tran.php} does not seem to check the extension of the uploaded files.\newline
	Also, while exploring the folder structure of the server, some leftover files were found, as well as hidden folders.
}{%
	If the user tries to upload any file other than a txt file, the server does not provide any error messages. This particular vulnerability will be discussed later in 3.X.X.\newline
	Additionally, leftover files (e.g. \url{http:/IPADDRESS/employee_registration.php~}) were not deleted from the server, as well as other files containing sensitive information. More specifically, this is the case of the .git folder.
}{%
	In order to access the hidden .git folder, however, an attacker must be skilled and know where to search for sensitive information.
}{%
	Having access to the data contained inside the hidden .git folder allows to potentially get access to the whole source code of the web application.

\vulntitle{OTG-SESS-001}{Testing for Bypassing Session Management Schema}
\vultable{\doge}{%
	When accessing the application, a randomly generated PHPSESSID session cookie is set. The cookie doesn't have an expiration date nor is it tagged as secure. Apparently the session cookie is already set before logging into the application. This cookie is simply replaced by a new one once the user logs out of the application. No other cookies are set. Also if the cookie is tampered with, the server automatically generates a new cookie, containing a new session ID.
}{%
	The PHPSESSID cookie has been discovered while intercepting HTTP requests/responses using Burp. The same cookie details were later on confirmed using the Cookies plugin for browser.
}{%
	\na
}{%
	Since the only used cookie only contains the session ID, even though it is easy to change the value of the cookie, no other session values are exposed to the user. It is still possible to hijack another session by changing the entire value of the cookie with the one associated to another user (see Session 004).

\section{Client Side Testing}
This section was prioritized as low, therefore the client side was not tested in depth. Furthermore, as stated in the OWASP testing guide, black box testing of the client side is usually not performed, since access to the source code is always available, as it needs to be sent to the client to be executed. Nevertheless, some potential vulnerabilities were found and briefly analyzed.
