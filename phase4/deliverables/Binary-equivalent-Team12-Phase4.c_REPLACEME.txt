C source code equivalent to the binary from other team

The goals of reverse engineering are:
- To understand what the algorithm of the program. You must write an equivalent program in C/C++
code for the given binary. Equivalent means that it must have the same input-output behavior, not
the same exact syntax or variable names.
- Extract any credentials and hidden secrets (keys) from the binary and JAR and write them in the
report.

C/C++ binary must be reverse engineered using:
- an (interactive) disassembler, e.g. IDA Free/Pro, objdump, Boomerang
- a debugger, e.g. gdb, IDA Free/Pro, ddd
- NOTE: This is a warm-up exercise for the obfuscation challenge in phase 5, which will be performed
by every student individually. Everyone is invited to reverse engineer this un-obfuscated binary to get
familiar with the concept/technique.
