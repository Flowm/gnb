                        Core of presentation: at this point in the presentation you must talk about:

                        Vulnerabilities (possible exploits of the vulnerabilities) and how you fixed them.
                        Feel free to go into technical details, but keep it short, clear and entertaining.
                        Report possible changes in OWASP and CVSS values (e.g. from high to medium,
                        etc.) including reasoning for these changes in the values.

						<h3>The HTTPS Migration</h3>
						<p class="fix-description">
							Moving the website from HTTP to HTTPS solved a large amount of issues that related to clear text data.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Moving the DocumentRoot of GitHUB</h3>
						<p class="fix-description">
							One of the major vulnerabilities was the fact that a few files were not proteceted, these files included sensitive infomration regarding the setup of our machine.
							
							Our solution was to change the github DocumentRoot to the folder that only contains the PHP code.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Timing Attack</h3>
						<p class="fix-description">
							One of the vulnerbilities was a timing attack, where the login page would reply within 50ms if the user was registered and within around 25mn if the user was not registered.
							
							While minor, this attack could be used to check whether a certain email is registered with gnb or not.
							
							To overcome this a random waiting period was introduced to all login attemps, making the response time less uniform and more random.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Unsanitized Input</h3>
						<p class="fix-description">
							Creating a unified sanitizing function was the solution to combating unsanitizaiton.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Integer overflow</h3>
						<p class="fix-description">
							This was due to a comparison between a long long value and an integer value inside the c parser. By changing the integer to a long long value,
							this is no longer possible
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Clickjacking</h3>
						<p class="fix-description">
							This has been rectified through the updated security policy and The X-FRAME-OPTIONS has been set to DENY.
						</p>

                        Fix slides: For each vulnerability discovered in Phase 2 by your team or the team that tested your
                        application, you should summarize the fix that you implemented:
                        - Path(s) of file(s) which was modified for the fix
                        - Line number(s) which were modified in each file
                        - NOTE: You can use a diff utility but you should only report the changes relevant for one particular
                        fix per vulnerability (not just a diff of all changes to phase 1).
                        - Textual description of your countermeasures and the reason why they fix the problem.
