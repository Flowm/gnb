\chapter{Executive Summary}

For the last phase of our project we were asked to fix all vulnerabilities if any were still remaining, document the Application architecture and mention all security features available on the GNB application.

Detailed architecture of the application is documented, from listing external libraries and each library's function, to how the different parts of the application (Apache Web Server, MySQL DB, Web Client and SmartCard Simulator) work together.

Names of the available PHP files and their functions is also described in detail. The decentralized control flow of the application, business flow and Client-side behavior are then discussed to provide a big picture view of the application.

Detailed DB Schema and SCS were also described in detail for completeness.

The report then lists all security measures available on the GNB application, while describing the measure, implementation and what it protects against.

The Last section of the report talks about any remaining fixes the GNB Application needed based on the provided OWASP checklist.
